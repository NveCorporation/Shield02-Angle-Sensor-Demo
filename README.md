# Shield02-Off-Axis-Sensor-Panel
Arduino Uno Shield02 demonstrates NVE ALT521 or AAT-, ADT- and ASR-Series angle/rotation sensors. The Shield shows how our sensors are limited only by your imagination.

The Shield connects via an edge connector to the breakout board above or other breakout boards. Sixty LEDs indicate the angle, and colors indicate direction of rotation. A diametrically-magnetized neodymium magnet is included, and a magnet fixture allows the magnet to be positioned on-axis or off axis.

Instructions:
  1.	Download Arduino IDE
  2.	Download the sketch for the sensor you are using from this repository.
  3.	Upload the sketch to an Arduino Uno.
  4.	Attach and the Shield02 to the Arduino Uno.
  5.	Insert the breakout board into the Shield02 edge connector.
  6.	Attach the plastic magnet guide to the Shield02.
  7.	Place magnet inside one of the magnet holders.
  8.	Spin the magnet and enjoy the show.
  9.	Press the button to toggle between different functions.
