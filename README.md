# Shield02-Off-Axis-Sensor-Panel
Arduino Uno Shield02 Off-Axis Sensor Panel Codes featuring our AAT's, ADT's, ASR002, ASR012, ASR022, ALT521

The Shield02 Off Axis Sensor is used to display that the limitation of our sensors is the imagination.
All of the sensors used in this demonstration are off axis sensors used to determine the angle/orientation
of the magnetic field given off by the neodinium magnet. The Shield also demonstraights how you may orient
the magnetic fields in different manners and still our sensors will be able to function with precision.

Instructions:
  1. Download Arduino IDE
  2. Copy and Paste the corresponding sensor code into Arduino IDE to flash the Arduino Uno
  3. Attach and Insert the Shield02-Panel into the pinout of the Arduino Uno
  4. Insert the Sensor Eval Board into the Shield02 insert slot
  5. Put the plastic casing on top the Shield02
  6. Spin the magnet and enjoy the show
  7. Press the button for different functions
